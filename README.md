## 🔮 Future Scopes

In the upcoming releases, we aim to launch a developer-focused **Drawer UI Library**, a plug-and-play toolkit that enables seamless integration of our 3D UI components into any e-commerce or portfolio platform. This library will empower devs to add immersive shopping experiences without rebuilding from scratch.

Features will include:

- `<ProductViewer />` React component
- ShadCN-compatible UI components
- Model hosting + CDN fallback
- Instant AR/VR-ready export for WebXR
